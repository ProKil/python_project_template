# Best Practices in Open-Source Machine Learning Research Projects in Python: A Template

This template, designed as the optimal springboard for your open-source Python research projects, is an ideal choice if you:

1. Seek to enable other researchers to build upon your project with ease;
2. Aim to minimize the communication gap between your project's collaborators;
3. Aspire to iterate rapidly while maintaining high confidence that minor code changes won't disrupt the entire pipeline;
4. Desire to decrease the number of frustrating Runtime Errors encountered during experiment execution.
