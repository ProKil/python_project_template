# What is this?

This is Python project template that I use for my projects.

## Features

1. `pyproject.toml` for managing dependencies and project metadata.
2. `mypy` for static type checking.
3. `pre-commit` for running code checks before committing.
4. `pytest` for running tests.
5. `mkdocs` for generating documentation.
